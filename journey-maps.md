# Journey Maps: The Case for Governance

The task of coming up with a vision of WordPress governance can be overwhelming. It’s a lot of responsibility to imagine what an ideal experience can be, then render the governance documentation to achieve and support that experience.

We have broken this task into smaller components and by doing so a **vision emerges** from a series of smaller tactics. (interviews, usability observation, personas, scenarios, & journey maps).

Here’s how teams have worked through the UX tactics:
* Identify Stakeholders and groups of Stakeholders
* Observe & interview people as they use current conditions in the WordPress ecosystem to work through tasks
* Note the order of steps use cases takes and measure each step frustrating or delightful
* Create a journey map that shows the experience of each with a horizontal timeline and marker that represent each step 
* Measure frustration and delight on the map using a vertical timeline 
* Resulting maps shows the current experience for that scenario 
* Create different maps for each Stakeholder and look for patterns that emerge 

This work, lead by UX Architect Cathi Bosco is a team effort by many contributing members of the WordPress community. The following documentation and research is for identifying specific evidence (pain points) and experiences useful for facilitating important conversations. This is a useful practice for the purpose of identifying problems in need of solutions.

## Journey maps

A journey map is a diagram that visualizes the journey of stakeholders as they interact or accomplish tasks within the WordPress project.

**How to read this document and journey maps:**
* Click through each map graphic to view and interact with the actual journey map at scale
* Each journey map highlights frustrating experiences and delightful experiences along the course of a set of tasks per stakeholder
* The pain points or frustrating experiences are highlighted in the red panels of the journey maps
* Both the delightful and frustrating experiences are noted in the bullet points below each chart
